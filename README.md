# NodeJS-MQTT-To-InfluxDB
This Node.js script receives MQTT messages, processes them, and writes them to an InfluxDB database. It utilizes the "mqtt" and "influx" modules and allows for the configuration of MQTT topics to be mapped to InfluxDB measurements. Additionally, it's worth noting that the JSON response can be customized as needed.
